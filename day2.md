# Basic data processing tutorials Day 2: Write your first Python code

## 1. Choose or create a folder
First, let's decide where to put the codes you will write. Create folders if necessary. 

### Windows example

    C:\Users\[your user name]\lab\Codes\first-python-code

### macOS example

    /Users/[your user name]/lab/Codes/first-python-code

In my case, I have a folder dedicated to studies in my Dropbox folder. So it's like

    /Users/[my user name]/Dropbox/lab/Codes/first-python-code

## 2. Add the folder to the VSCode workspace
VSCode has a feature called *workspace*. It's like a virtual folder, into which real folders can be added. The added folders can be accessed in the Explorer side bar. 

First, show the Explorer side bar.
